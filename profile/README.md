Collaborative Iot is a platform built for real-time control/monitoring 
of smart devices as a collective group with real-time audio and chat functionality.

Things you could see when joining a collaborative IoT room:
- People audio/text chatting in real-time.
- Room administrators giving room members access to their server that is connected to the room.
- Live IoT control board for each room. 
- Twitch style chat with gifs and other animations.
- Room admin levels.

There are many reasons to collaborate on IoT projects with peers or friends, Collaborative allows this without having to directly hand over
authentication credentials to a person with the given ability to pass around permissions to your server. A connection in a room to an IoT server
is owned by one user and this user controls access.


Supported IoT servers:
- [House-Of-Iot](https://github.com/House-of-IoT)
- [Home Assistant(coming soon)](https://github.com/home-assistant)


This project started as a fork of the [DogeHouse Project](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse). It is no longer associated with the original project at all!
