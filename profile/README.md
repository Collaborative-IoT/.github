## Welcome to Collaborative IoT

This organization is a collection of software that make up the collaborative Iot platform. Collaborative Iot is a platform built for real-time control/monitoring 
of smart devices as a collective group with real-time audio and chat functionality.


This project started as a fork of the [DogeHouse Project](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse). It is no longer associated with the original project at all!
