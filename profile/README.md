Collaborative Iot is a platform built for real-time control/monitoring 
of IoT servers as a collective group with real-time audio/chat functionality and added security.

Things you could see when joining a collaborative IoT room:
- People audio/text chatting in real-time(the communication is like : clubhouse voice system + twitch chat).
- Room administrators giving room members access to their IoT server that is connected to the room.
- Live IoT control board display for each room. 
- Twitch style chat with gifs and other animations.
- Room admin levels.

There are many reasons to collaborate on IoT projects with peers or friends, Collaborative allows this without having to directly hand over
authentication credentials to a person, each user has the ability to pass around permissions to their server and revoke them. A connection in a room to an IoT server
is owned by one user and this user controls access.


Supported IoT servers:
- [House-Of-Iot](https://github.com/House-of-IoT)
- [Home Assistant(coming soon)](https://github.com/home-assistant)

Want to self host? Check the documentation for detailed instructions.

The repositories in this organization are named after the 12 knights of the round table to signify collective collaboration.

This project started as a fork of the [DogeHouse Project](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse) for the frontend features. It is no longer associated with the original project at all, 90% of the fork has been rewritten!
